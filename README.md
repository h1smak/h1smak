### :man_technologist: About me:

I am a beginner Flutter developer. I started learning programming in college with languages like Python and C#. After that, I got interested in Android and iOS app development, and I've been working in that field up until today. Since the beginning of 2023, I've been studying Flutter development through Udemy School courses. Currently, I am in the process of searching for a job.
